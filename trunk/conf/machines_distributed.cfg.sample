# KFS Machine configuration file
#
# The following configuration is for a multi-node KFS setup.  There is
# one meta server and 3 chunk servers. The chunk servers are exporting 
# 300,000,000 bytes or 300G apiece.  Note that, though the baseport
# for the chunkservers is the same on all nodes, because the nodes are
# different, the values are unique on each node; similary for the
# rundir of the chunk servers.
